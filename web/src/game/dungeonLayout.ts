/**
 * dungeonLayout.ts
 *
 * Where the dungeon's maps draw each cell of a level (this port's, after the Ultima V port's dungeonMap.ts). A level
 * is sixteen cells a side and wraps: a step off one edge comes in at the other, and the first-person view at an edge
 * looks across it. Fifty of the game's 56 levels were laid out inside a wall along their first column and row, which
 * bounds them on both sides through the wrap; Mines of Morinia's fourth has a passage across its top and bottom
 * edges, and five levels (Morinia's second, third and seventh, Dardin's Pit's first and fourth) have passages right
 * round. A map drawing the grid as it is kept puts the wall beside a party at the east edge on the far west.
 *
 * So each level is looked at for its seams - a column or row of wall all the way across, which no passage crosses -
 * and whether its passages loop (`levelShape`), and drawn by them:
 *
 * - round the party (`aroundParty`: Top down, and the 5x5 map beside the first-person view), the party in the middle
 *   and the level moving round it: its passages walked out from where the party stands, each cell drawn where it lies
 *   from the party and never again where the grid wraps it round, and the rock beside them; the level's other parts
 *   (reached by other ladders) where they lie by its seams, or the nearer way round across an edge with none. Where
 *   the passages loop round the level it goes on past its edges as it begins.
 * - the whole level (`wholeLevel`: View map), still: cut at its seams, a seam's wall drawn at both ends, beside the
 *   passages it bounds at each; along an edge its passages cross, as it is kept.
 *
 * Only what the auto-map shows (automap.ts cellVisible) is drawn; a seam's wall at one end only where a passage beside
 * it there is shown too, so walking one edge does not draw the other.
