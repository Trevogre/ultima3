/**
 * journal.ts
 *
 * The quest journal (this port; the Apple II had none), after the Ultima V port's: a list of what the quest asks
 * for, and of the places it asks the party to go, each with how far it has got there. It records what the world has
 * told the party and what the party has done, so a newcomer can play without a walkthrough, and stays out of the way
 * of anyone who never opens it.
 *
 * The top of the journal is six lines, each opening to more:
 *
 * - Main quest: the nine steps to Exodus. After the first, an audience with Lord British, they may be taken in any
 *   order, so all are listed - each a mystery until something has told of it (a clue tagged with it, or a start
 *   made on it).
 * - Towns: Lord British's castle and the ten towns - undiscovered, seen, or entered with so many of their clues
 *   heard (CLUES: the townsfolk's lines that bear on the quest). Dawn and the three towns on isles are mysteries
 *   till seen, entered or told of.
 * - Dungeons: the seven - undiscovered, seen, or entered with so many of their goals found (a mark's rod stood on,
 *   the Time Lord met).
 * - Ambrosia: its four shrines, and the cards found in them.
 * - Equipment: what the party can go and get - a guild's supplies, Dawn's magic weapons and armour, a ship - each
 *   done once found, and the moongates come out of. (The exotic arms are a main-quest step.)
 * - Words: the words Other answers to, each learnt by being heard said (CLUES' `word`). A controller's Other offers
 *   only these (interact.ts); a keyboard may type anything, as on the Apple II.
 *
 * Every line has a card (what the party knows of it, shown over the party panel while it is highlighted) and a
 * hint, a plain line written for this port that the game itself never speaks: printed to the message area only when
 * asked for, and nothing remembers the asking. Hints are kept short enough for that area: sixteen columns, nine
 * lines.
 *
 * What can be read from the party, the auto-map and the flags is; the rest (clues heard, words learnt, dungeon goals
 * found) is recorded as it happens. The whole state lives in the save file.
